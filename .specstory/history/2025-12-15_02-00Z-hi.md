Hi. How can I help?

I see you're working on an AI tutorials project with a RAG phase 1 implementation using LlamaIndex. What would you like to work on?

You're in the workspace:

**`/Users/lamsumchat/Documents/coding_projects/playground/ai_tutorials/agentalpha/`**

This workspace contains:

1. **`rag-phase1/`** — RAG implementation with:
   - `rag_demo.py` and `rag_demo.ipynb`
   - PDF documents in `data/`
   - Chroma vector store in `storage/`
   - Requirements file and README

2. **`.specstory/`** — History/documentation files

3. Root level — Project configuration files

Do you want to:
- Navigate to a specific file or directory?
- See what's in a particular folder?
- Work on something specific in your project?

Tell me what you'd like to do.

I mean my ip address.

I can't access your IP address from here. You can find it with:

**On macOS (Terminal):**
```bash
# Local IP address (on your network)
ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1

# Or more specifically:
ipconfig getifaddr en0  # for Wi-Fi
ipconfig getifaddr en1  # for Ethernet
```

**To find your public IP address:**
```bash
curl ifconfig.me
# or
curl ipinfo.io/ip
```

I can help you run these commands or check network-related code in your project. Should I continue?
